Thought 1-35

- Mod 2 polynomial arithmetic is the same thing as transmission error
- The degree of a polynomial is its length... Nah, its length is1 more than that because degree can go all the way to zero
- The medium access sublayer
- Mean time delay (how much does a frame take to get to the otherend): 1 / [(channel capacity) * (1/mean bit pretty frame) -(arrival rate, you must wait for other frames)]
- The specs for D Flip-Flop uses assertion-level logic, whichmeans that when you see an input like ~S, you know that it is anactive-low input and the thing it is trying to do (in this case,setting the flip-flop) can be achieved by setting it to Low andvice-versa
- Yes, you can design your own SR Latch from the ground up, andit looks totally different too (albeit not as cool). Man I love SRLatches so much!
- I think I've said this already, but the stair lighting switchsystem can be implemented by a simple XOR operation. The two HIGHstates are distant 2 from each other and so are the two LOW states.The true usefulness of this switch is that to change from HIGH toLOW or vice-versa you only need to flip one bit. Ooh, you knowwhat? With XOR we can even install 3, 4 or as many switches as wewant and they still work the same way as the 2 system (even the 1system is XOR-based if you wanna be rigorous).
- To prove the previous thing, we call a system of switches aunidistant system if toggling any single switch in the systemtoggles the output also. 1-switch system is obviously unidistant;and if an n-switch system is uni-distant then obviously ann+1-switch (the last switch is connected by XOR to form the output)is also unidistant. Thus... QED I guess
- In expanding to the uni-distant thing, AND and OR shares thesame property. Why? We can describe an OR system with EXISTS, anAND system with FORALL. We can see that OR preserves EXISTS and ANDpreserves FORALL, thus we can do these operations however welike.
- in two's complement number scheme,  we increment one toget to the biggest number to the smallest (negative) number. Therest goes on like normal (-1 increment to get 0, etc). The "sign"bit acts like normal bit, except it is a minus. For example, 1100is -4 because --8 + 4 = 4 (owned). NEVER underestimate simplearithmetic
- It's funny how you have a model of something and it candescribe a simple case and you're confident that it works; but whenconfronted with a more complicated case it collapses to a merecoincidence
- Even if someone tries to fool you into thinking that you've gotthe right answer, would you be truly happy then?
- The thing is: in any implicant, if 2 variables change at thesame time then we cannot do anything to predict the states (will xchange first or will y change first?): We must ban thiscompletely
- If no two inputs of ANY gate change simultaneously, we thenmetastability is...
- Expecting something to turn out the way you want it to is likebanging your head against a brick wall: STOP DOINGIT!
- There is a reason why I cannot make the counter reset to theinitial state like I want it to without preset and set: it's simplybecause of the edge-triggered nature of the flip-flop. You can onlychange the state of the flip-flops once the it's triggered, whichmeans the next clock cycle. You can't simply say: "Hey this thing'sreached the state I don't want it to, let's change it to xyzIMMEDIATELY because I want to
- Some genius thought of the idea of preemptively detect theupper bound (do it one number earlier) and hope that the next clockcycle we can just set-reset synchronously like normal: Nope! Didn'twork either because the you can't provide the clock to moresignificant digits. It just doesn't work according to the clock,you know?
- Dude, if the flip flop detects rising edge, then it will countbackward, that is so fucking cool!
- Fixed it anyway! I wouldn't have noticed it had it not been forthe homework lol!
- Gray code is what we call "distant 1 counting"
- post-fix or reverse polish notation is the best: no parenthesesneeded! you have the stack
- An n-bit codeword has log(n) + 1 Hamming parity bit:r = log(n) + 1 = log(m + r) + 1 (*).
- The theoretical limit is: m + r + 1 <= 2^r.Â There you have it! m + r + 1 = 2^(log (m + r) + 1)
- The hamming code can pin-point the error by checking the paritybit since each parity position error combination can be deduced toa single position. For example, we know that bit 10 is wrongbecause parity bits 2 and 3 are wrong.
- Since the log function we use is a round-down function (seeequation * above), we can minimize waste by using n that is 1 lessthan a power of two (3, 7, 15, 31...)
- By the way, if we detect an error at a power of two position,then the parity bit is wrong.
- Proof the the minimum distance between each code-word is 3: ifwe change 1 bit, that is trivial because we can correct it, if wechange 2 bits, the only fun situation we can have is that oneparity bit and one message bit are changed (because otherwise weflat out have an error). You know what? We don't need to prove itthis way because we know that every 1 bit error can be correctedand so the minimum distance between each valid code-word must be3.
- But still, we must know that we can detect 2 errors (even if wecan't correct it). And still, we know that we can because we'veproven that the minimum distance is 3
- What I'm trying to say is: since each message bit is checked byat least 2 other parity bits, we can guarantee in an intuitive waythat each valid code-word is 3 bits apart: We can change a validcode-word into another valid one without changing 3 bits.
- We can send a frame of bits columns by columns (meaning thateach line will be a code-word that can be checked separately). SoBurst errors can be corrected, too (I know of this but it's stillamazing!).
- In short, if you want to correct 1 error and the block size isn (including the parity bits that somehow you know), take log2of n
- Some good news: the bigger the block size, the lower the numberof parity bits needed to correct a single error (provided that ONLYONE error can occur on the entire block)
- One mechanical way to find the Hamming parity is to scan r onthe natural domain. Sure it isn't really mathematical but thefunction is still O(log(m)) since the parity method scales sowell
- That being said, error detecting is still way better: usingmatrix parity with n bit wide, the probability of false-negative is1/2^n (in a long burst or in multiple shorter burst)
- When you've sweat blood and tears on something, you will startto love it. No matter what it is: a bicycle, a computer system, ora child
- If the future is darkness, and the present is the light. Thenwhat is the past? And how do I turn on the light?
- More on SR latch: every state must support input (0,0). Why?Because that's the default input, like, in the case of poweroutage, everything will be zero and so your data should be that,too
- The perfect Gray code: 00, 01, 10
- Or: 11, 10, 01 (SR latch with NAND)
- More perfect code: 000, 001, 010, 100 (not as interesting as Ithought)
- Wait, you CAN jump from (0,0) to (1,1), and the state you canbe in is deterministic. It's not like you can't jump from (1,1) to(0,0), but then you have 2 states you can be in. But, if we analyzethe situation in the q way, we can determine the state! Of course,it there are various delays then there's no discussion. But what ifthere is none?
- Remarks: even if there are stable states for a particular setof inputs, there is no guarantee that you can enter that state. Youmust have down the intermediate states first
- The state of a circuit should be determined by all the gates'output
- The state is illegal NOT because of the propagation delay, butit's because of something more fundamental
- EXACTLY, the simulated circuit fluctuates from a to d, just asthe flow table predicts. The flow table with every gates' states ISthe Oracle
- It's fun to describe nature with simple mathematics. It is sucha huge pain to keep the simulation in your head. The compressionthat math brings is similar to Revelation
- Everybody can be wrong, every document can be misleading. Sodon't trust everything you read.
- So, yeah, you've pushed yourself to work all-day on thevim/latex transition. Now you've done it. Got anything to say? Howam I feeling right now? Do I even have feelings right now? Whatdoes anything mean anymore? Should I be working this hard? This isthe hardeset I've ever worked in my life, will I ever see it payoff?
- yeah, I miscalculated it, guys! I should have focused on thebibliography part because that part is the most volatile tochanges. Instead, I did the layout & formatting and ended upburning my soul down to the ground. BUT! I must be convincedbeforehand that LaTex can format the page because otherwise it willbe too fucking dangerous to make the switch. Anyways, there is noanswer to life at all. Hindsight is always 10/10 and we can onlylive one life

- Using DroidCam for cutting your own hair is a pretty goodoption

- Oh my god that's how you build counter? That's just...ingenious!
- In sequential circuits, "triggering" means "changing":pulse-triggered means "changeable during pulse"; and edge_triggeredmeans "changeable right before pulse"

- Default gateway has netmask 0.0.0.0, what does that mean(grin)Â

Behold! The Boolean-Natural Isomorphism (this was definitelyproven before me but I can't bother to actually find thatout)

- How to know if the natural number's operations are identicalto AND and OR:
- We say that boo(n) the function to convert a natural numberto boolean values, it converts 0 to F and every other number toT

We need to prove that the boolean operations preserve whenconverting natural numbers to binary:
which means: addition is preserved, multiplication ispreserved:
+ additions is preserved: prove that boo(a + b) = boo(a) ORboo(b):
destruct boo(a + b), if boo(a + b) = F, we can see that thisholds; if boo(a + b) = 1 then a or b > 0, we can also see thatthis holds
+ product is preserved: prove that boo(a * b) = bin(a) ANDbin(b)
destruct boo(a * b), if ab = 0 then a = 0 or b = 0 then wealready see the proof; if a*b = 1 then... we already saw theproof
+ complementation is preserved boo(1 - n) = NOT boo(n)
I don't wanna do this again, QED.

So that's it! We've proven that the methods we use work: wecan use PLUS for OR, MULT for AND and [1-n] for NOT(n)
But wait! How can we actually use natural number's subtractionin Excel?
In conclusion: just use normal Excel boolean functions, yourmethod sucks anyway

boo((1 - 2) + 1) = FALSE with integer subtraction and TRUEwith natural subtraction
NOT(boo(2)) OR 1 = TRUE... so integer subtraction is totallywrong

- Soo, how are 2D tables (like Karnaugh maps) different from 1Dtables really? They're not that different, in fact, 1D tables canbe converted to 2D maps easily by breaking the verticle line downto two or more pieces, then stack them on top of each otherhorizontally
- Your life is not pre-planned, it is as free as the wind
- Transition table is just like Karnaugh map, but for internaloutputs instead of external output
- The flow table can determine how we can change the state of theexternal output
- SR-latch: there are two different ways to determine thefeedback path, but you only need to choose ONE. Actually, you canchoose both of them, both of them have their own beauty
- It funny how you think you know something but you actuallyfucking don't. But finally every makes sense
- NOW nothing can stop me from analyzing the shit out ofsequential circuit, motherfucker!
- There is no "most efficient" way to construct IPv4 subnetmechanism. Using a bit to represent public and private? No, that islike... Wasting 2 billion addresses; plus there is nothing concretesuch as public and private, really. After all, the Internet is justa giant network with some address space dedicated for private use.That's exactly the same as subnetting your small company network:after you've subnetted, you can't use that address space outside ofthat subnet! Exactly like how you can't use 192.168... foraddressing public devices.
- How come the router remembers who sent the message on theprivate Network? First of all, the server only knows about thepublic network address of the client. And the router only needs toknow just that. Because all it does is check the destination IPagainst its routing table. If there's a match on one of its directinterfaces, it will just send the packet there. Doesn't matter ifthere are multiple computers behind the network: that's layer 2'sjob, the switch's job, the MAC address's job! Oh man this thing isso beautifully designed!
- Well, the last two bullets were kinda... wrong.
- All I know is that the packet doesn't change IP for everyrouter it encounters, so why is it that the IP changed from aprivate to a public network?
- NAT and port forwarding are the particular suspects. Routersneed a port number to remember the connection. So... ports arekinda important, guys
- I also noticed Law I (or whatever number that is) of ThermoDynamics: signals are never created or destroyed. All logics gatesdraw their power from the 5V source. One example of the NOT gate:when there seems to be no input signal, it will output a high powerlevel drawn directly from source
- Dude, you need to stop going to the wrong toilet, man!
- Btw, relax, there's nothing to get upset about
- Quantum entanglement can transfer information faster than thespeed of light?Â
- Well, I take the StarCraft thing back: but take it as a form ofregulated entertainment; not mandatory business. I'll only watchGSL or events with Tastosis

- Lesson learned today: don't blame your shit on some soullessthings (and anything, really); also, help people and let peoplehelp you
- Can you understand the system? = If you don't have anyknowledge about the system, can you deisgn it by yourself?
- The result for the subnet problem is here: on a network with mbits, we reserve an address with n flexible bits for privateconnections
    - The initial # of hosts: 2^m
    - # of public hosts after reserved: 2^m - 2^n (no good way towork out the math, but apparently it's a small difference beforeand after)
    - # of hosts / private network: 2^n
    - Wait for it...
    - the total # of devices we can serve: 2^n * (2^m - 2^n) = 2^(n +m) - 2^(2n)
    - How many times that numer increased: 2^n - 2^(2n - m)
    - Graph for the above function:Â
Plot[2^n (1 - 2^(-32 + n)), {n, 0, 10}]
    - It is not really different from an exponential function
    - And another graph which shows how many public addresses we lostvs how many hosts we can gain:
    - Plot[{4294967296 - 2^n, 2^n - 4^(-16 + n)}, {n, 0, 31}]
    - We lost BARELY anything! And we gain so much
    - Conclusion: Network Address Translation is great!
- The principle of locality (the law which says that we tend toreuse things we used recently): has it been proven Â byevolution (by the fact that we tend to remember things we justdid)?
- I'm afraid that my working cycle does not correspond with thesun and the moon
- Turing recognizer will always accept, it just won't halt onsome inputs it doesn't accept
- If I hadn't recognized this fallacy, the there is a recognizerfor every languages: a machine that runs forever on all inputs
- We can't make a machine that recognizes that a machine does notaccept an input
- Regarding proof by construction: There are two kinds ofobjects, the constant and the variables
- So the ports can be used by the router, even though they'relevel 4, to work out which machine ordered what. It matchesoriginal ports with its own kind of port... bla bla bla the OSImodel costs money so nobody cares
- And I thought I couldnt' make my terminal look better: enterPywal! OMG it is so beautiful! Makes we love playing around withprogramming again.
- How to make grey code in excel: make an indexed column for theworking table. First enter 01, then copy it down below, then useinverted sort on the index column to invert the copied area. Movethe index column to the left. populate the original table with 0and the copied one below with 1 (if you're quick you can reuse theprevious 0s and 1s to speed things up). Repeat until you haveenough digits.
- I'm doing quite fine today. Wait, has this finally become adiary? Nah, the point is that I like Gray code, I like applicationof it as well. And also, it was created in Bell Lab
- I've observed a lot and come to conclusion: the ones smilingand relaxing the most are always the top. You must have lots ofconfidence and strong mentality to pull that off. No need tointimidate anyone when you actually feel strong.
- Another hard fact: I don't think my greedy strategy is gonnawork lol. I don't have enough time for that much thinking
- The use of MAC address: devices in a LAN can change IP, sowhat? If all the end device know is IP then you can't use MACanywhere else, right? Ooh, you can't really use switch ports toidentify devices on a network because... there are many switchesinvolved in a LAN. There are many network protocols other than IP,so... flexibility problem. The adapter will have to reconfigure itsIP every time (and it can be moved, too). And the Internet layerhas to deal with crap that wasn't even intended to be sent to it.In short, keep the layers separated as well as possible
- Proof of methodology: Q holds only if there exists a P suchthat P holds and P -> Q. Including False and itself
- What about "destruct" (It's match)? What about "forall"(It's just function application)?
- Encounter problem with negative subtraction? Just take a 2'scomplement at the end like you do with decimal. This shit is easy,don't be scared
- Mechanically solving problem is fine, but sometimes you need tobe flexible and creative to overcome errors and fallacies
- You do need subnet mask along with the network address to fullydescribe the network
- Ask a question, take on a challenge: that's how you learn.Playing is a serious thing
- Trying to solve the "subnet problem" is probably the motivationof classful address
- Levels of consciousness:
    - Level 0 : absolutely no control (unconscious)
    - Level 1 : daytime consciousness
    - Level 2 : reflection (think about how you think)
    - Level n... controls level n-1
- Why can't we control everything? We don't have enough brainpower for that. That's why we must group some fundamentalfunctionality of the body and hand it to the reptilian brain.Absolutely zero alternation allowed!
- Of course we can group other thoughts together as well to formmethods or abstractions. Allowing higher leveled thinking
- Oops, I think I mixed up level of control and level ofabstraction.
- Sarcasm from the author against himself can be seen assomething deep... Like the author thinking he's evil. Roster teethshirts anyone? Oh my God my dreams are hilarious
- Stop overextending!
- Communication is hard man, so cringy. But don't give up justyet!
- Time to kiss StarCraft II goodbye...
- Your reason to exist is the same as the sun's, the moon's, thesky's and the sea's.
- Every time you want to give up, think about the reason why youstarted.

- More about function space of X x Y: it is a set of all functionwhich maps X to Y (called Z). If X has m members, Y has n members,then the n(Z) = m^n. So this set is often called "X^Y" or "X ->Y". We can make up any operations we want, we only need a table forit!

- Javelin problem finale:
    - First, prove that in a tetragon with center inside: the squareis the best. The area is dictated by the angle. Ha, this problemseems solid because they are for triangles, go for the throat andkill each one
    - Second: prove that the center inside is better than outside.You can do this by duplicating a center outside tetragon and seethat it's futile against the strongest piece: a square. How do weknow if we can duplicate and they won't overlap. Through thedefinition of convex and a really tricky move when you must assumethat a point is on both tetragon. Blows my mind how hard itis.
- With the above victory, I am confident that I've defeatedmyself 3 years ago
- About the shape of the spring:
    - Long story short: yes, the shape is sinusoida, when you look atit from the side
    - Let's name 3 dimension here: z is the stretching length, y isthe diameter, and x is the other dimention (I mean, there's no needto distinguish x and y)
    - We can see it as an object orbiting another object that ismoving forward in the 3rd dimension
    - we have y = A * sin (w*t) (A being the diameter of the spring wis the x-y angular velocity)
    - x = A * cos (w*t) (see, no difference from y)
    - z = v * t (v being the velocity of the straight-movingobject)
    - What you need to do? substitute t=z/v to y or x, you have asinusoidal function of z: y = A * cos (w/v*z), hooray
    - Well, there may be some other stuff to experiment like howimaginary number wraps all this into a function.
    - And INVERSE of trigonometric functions(they're just gonnathemselves again, I know) (Oh wait, they look different, with thedomain of sin and cos being restricted, and they don't look likeanything) (oh, here I am being silly again, it just look exactlylike that, but 90 degree rotated)
    - Oh, and there's more, when you stretch the spring out, you'reactually decreasing w (or increasing v). And w/v is like the 3rddimensional velocity of the spring

Map

- When I go blind, I can use the gomoku board for children tostore my thought
- Due to the vast number of routes, what I'm doing right now isnot depth first or breadth first search. It's heuristic search:learning & biased. Sometimes I spend time digging deep,occasionally I jump to other things, but the rules of searchingmust always apply (read thought 1 for detail)
- Another rule for path finding: minimize the branch switchingbecause it causes overhead (you tend to forget things, that's whydigging deeper is more effective because you remember what you'redoing). Only switch branch when you get stuck. Bonus: you shouldalso minimize the number of branches you dig because unfamiliaritycan cause overhead as well.
- Pattern recognition can help machines get out of a dead loop:branch A stuck -> B -> dig -> stuck -> A stuck > C(because B is stuck now)
- A whole new strategy: assign each branch a value S (stuck) or P(potential). An unexplored branch is P. We select 1 branch A(profession) as primary:
    - Dig branch A until stuck
    - If stuck: mark A as S, dig another branch marked P (in alphabetorder).
    - If stuck, mark as S, dig another P branch until exploredsucceed. Mark all branches as P and return to dig primary branch,which should be P now.
- Note:
    - the previous can be reduced to a simple Turing machine withonly two states. Like this:
        - state 1: explored -> dig branch A
        - state 2: stuck -> dig next branch
    - The Turing machine version sure is absurdly plain and easy toknow prove that it won't go into a dead loop. But it doesn't showwhat I had in my mind when I designed it, it doesn't show therequirements of the search:
    - This algorithm won't make sure you will get to the end of theprimary branch.
    - It does make sure that you won't dig the same hole withouthaving gained additional knowledge from the last time
    - It makes sure you make progress (getting stuck does not mean noprogress)
    - It minimizes the switching branch process and the number ofbranches
- "Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solvethe halting problem for all possible program-input pairscannot exist". Ha, it means that I can solve the halting problem aslong as I can restraint either the program or the input, orboth.

- Dream: put me into situations that I fear the most so that Ican devise a plan while on pressure
- Password: what if I turn some text into bar code and use it aspassword? It'll be good (Nope)
- Concept of a key: you keep with yourself or in your memory. Asimple text is not enough because it's so easy to guess. By usinganother account, the key is hard to get because you have to knowwhich account to get, which file I stored the pass in. This can'tbe found without my memory.

- SC 2: if the number of worker increases steadily over time, theresources gathered should be a jagged version of a parabola.That's why increasing the number of workers in the beginningincreases the pace of the game so much... I give up on proving thisone. But I find that any given time, the total resources gatheredwill be larger by k*T (k is the number of initial workerincreased).
- I also learned about inverse function and how to change thegraph to get inverse function (tilt to the left 90 degree, flip tothe right and then change the axes name)
- How to draw a jagged parabola: start from point (0;0), forevery grid on the paper, go up as you you progress: horizontal line-> go up 1 -> go up 2 -> go up 3 -> go up 4 -> go up5 -> ... -> tada! This shows the amazing beauty ofmathematics and how the parabola works in StarCraft. if you havereally small grid line, you will get a smooth parabola
- Drawing: to explain why the heck this happen, we should learnabout jagged function

- Don't limit yourself: you don't have to use just one language,one philosophy, one rule.
- Fuzzy logic: there's no good and bad; there's only better orworse
- Language is a river. Don't try to control how the riverflows.

- In the bigger view, computers are just tools. Every tools arecreated to solve a problem and the problems that they create. In asense, humans are also tools of ourselves.
- That said, there's no rule that says a tool can't be used tosolve a problem it wasn't created
- So the best way to understand a tool is to ask: "what are youtrying to do?"
- Every time, I work hard for one day and the next day I couldn'tdo anything.
- The ultimate reason why I failed so hard at coding for telecom:the bastards don't write down all the little details, I have to doit all by myself! I can't do that! But in math, everything is sowell-written so I can only do this to math, right? Conclusion:goddamn life wasted
- More reasons: the big pictures are usually dismissed: forexample: does that telecom system have a transmission method? Idon't know, seems like yes but people would just assume that we'dknow that. So yeah...

- Heart of the story: like in the case of The Labyrynth ofMagic. At the beginning, every encounter of the main characterscount. There were so many things going on psychologically, notphysically. At the end of season 2: oh my god the fights areextreme, but there isn't any impact at all on the relationship ofthe characters. Those are just events and that's all they are. WhatI'm saying is: many stories keep on elevating in DEPTH andIMPRESSIVENESS and BOOM, but the characters are lackluster andnothing seems to relate to each other anymore so who cares.

- When talking about 'understanding'. Simply asking "Do youunderstand this?" makes no sense. You literally can't open my brainlike a HDD and see that the content inside my head is correct ornot. You and I can only get to an understanding by comparing theresult of our work together: 1 + 1 = 2; If I get 10 math problemscorrectly then you are probably sure that for time being I havememorized the concept and I probably knew how things work. Withoutconstantly checking your memory and the logic of everything, youcan't know that you understand shit. That's why the telecom labsare also fucking bullshit: nothing runs, no results given ->what did we do wrong? Not enough time, no guidance

- Osmosis is a fun phenomenon: if we place two salt-water partside-by-side separated by a semipermeable membrane (which onlypermits water to pass through and not salt). The side with moresalt concentration will 'suck' the water from the side with lesswater and won't even give it back. Plants use this to attractwater: they store up some solute in cells which are guarded bymembranes and thus attract water and balance their water nutrition.How do human use this? We can use membranes as a kind of diode. Weput salt water on one side and apply pressure to it: pure waterwill flow to the other side and won't come back. Why won't theycome back? Because of the pressure which has to be higher than theosmotic pressure. I modified the the wine-water program tostimulate this in python (because this can be explained through theprobability theory)

- Thomas Edison risked his life to save a boy. Then the father ofthat boy gave him a job as a grateful gift. Well, now I have to begpeople to give me job with suits and ties and Bachelor degrees andshit
- Saving one is killing one
- Doing anything more slowly is better and it feels better,too
- There is something constant about every living thing, everyreligion, every political party and every society. That everythingmust sustain itself. And the best way to do it is to out-reproduceother things
- Inverse functions: how to think about inverse functions: if youcan wrap a function f^(-1)(x) around another function f(x) and thenit returns x. then f^(-1) is the inverse function of f(x)
- Symmetry, something about dihedral symmetric group, grouptheory: I used those in tic-tac-toe machine
- Wanna stay truly focused? Don't breathe
- I know why Mikalo has several one account on 4 banks: theprocess of transferring money between banks takes a really longtime because banks could go bust in the middle of thetransaction
- AlphaGo: the idea of constraining the problem space is used:there is are actually two parts of the program: one explores theprobability of the moves, and one plays the games from those moves.The one that explores the possibility picks restraint the movesthat are possible for the other to use that to make a move
- How to represent combinations: prime numbers! Multiply themtogether and you'll get a unique combination. It can work withgroups of 4, 5, or anything you can come up with.
- A logical operation on with 3 nodes can be represented onlywith 2 numbers: a number for the parent the a number for thechildren
- I want to create a mapping function, an efficient mappingfunction. Which is redundant because functions map one input toonly one output. BUT, can I make it so that one output onlycorresponds to one input? That means that there can be an inversefunction created from the first function.
- Using prime number is efficient because there is an inversefunction which can map one number to a group of prime number
- When mapping a group with order, it is clearly efficient usinga string with characters in space n (the number of possiblechoices)
- How to formally describe the term 'efficient': a function isefficient if its domain is as large as its co-domain.
- But what if one of them is infinitely large? We must somehowset up some kind of constraint. Then we continue to say that: withany constraint, the domain must be as large as the co-domain
- Another obvious thing: the domain must always be at least aslarge as the co-domain in order for it to be classified as afunction (There is nothing such as a function mapping a smaller setto a bigger set)
- What I mean by co-domain: the set of all the possible output ofthe mapping. The square root of x function doesn't map the integerset to the real number set. All it does is map the integer set tosome subset of the positive part of the real number set
- I kind of want to make a machine that takes in numbers from 0to infinity and then outputs the number of prime elements ithas.
- 1 prime can represent 2 number (not counting squares or cubes),2 primes can represent 4, 3 can represent 8, 4 can represent16
- Is there a way to predict how many prime numbers there will bebased in the next l numbers on the combinations of prime numbers?Squares seem to be a really big obstacle for this.
- Maybe the function to map expressions to number is as hard astrying to look at a number and say: 'Is it a prime?' Doing that islike being able to know the answer before even computing it
- Hmm, then how can I know the number of combination before doingthe combinations myself?
- There must be a way to expand the stream efficiently byevaluating each node (the left must be less than or equal to theright)
- In fact, the 'combination' problem can also be solved byordering values of nodes
- I've found a way to absolutely eliminate symmetry inexpression: search nodes of the same level. If two or more nodeshave identical paths, they must be put in order
- I don't care about consciousness, I don't care about thingsbeing freaky or weird. I follow the rules and crack all thecodes
- How to remove similar destination on the fly with tic-tac: justorder the location of the moves: move n must be to the left and/orabove move n+1. But this doesn't remove symmetry
- Principle of locality: a specific group of functions and datais so regularly that it's better to improve a small area ratherthan improving everything
- That's right: you only need the page table for the pages you'regonna use, why not load them when loading the pages, also
- There's no differences between understanding and memorization.Understanding is just memorization of more generalizedinformation
- A machine cannot be the most efficient (to some criterion) andbe smart at the same time.
- Sooner or later, you will realize that what you're doing iswrong. There is no reason to stop realizing
- A hash function can replace a table
- We tend to use the word 'except' as a way of both stating anddismissing. Like the phrase: 'everyone except me is stupid'. Thatsentence is used as 'everyone except me is stupid, BUT I am notstupid'.
- Sometimes (I'm not saying 'always') storing information usingVenn diagram is more efficient than memorizing every fact abouteverything, if one portion of the Venn diagram tends to cluster.Like this: if x is a bird then x can fly, except if x is a penguinor a chicken. But I don't know if it's worth drawing the Venndiagram or not
- One of the reason why education fails is that they can beexploited. Schools tell us when to do this and when to do that andwhat to do, and at the end of the year everything is reset. Butthat is not life. Life tends to reward the resilient ones, the onessticking to himself and keep going steadily at every moment.
- The 'you can have freedom as long as you don't violate other'sfreedom' mantra doesn't work. In a world with limited resources,one's freedom is another's restriction
- You may think I don't like competition. I actually do, but notwith you pretty humans.
- Do I really like networking? I don't know
- Now I understand why file handling is done like that: it'sactually disk reading, it's I/O. Why it's it on the disk? Becauseof the restriction of main memory, of the hardware level below
- I feel like sometimes it's beneficial to over-exert yourself.Because when you get out of your comfort zone a little bit, youstart to get out there and try out crazy things. If everything istoo methodological and mechanical, the state of your mind justwon't change
- What does integral have anything to do with the area under itsderivative. well, the integral is the accumulated sum of itsderivative. the derivative shows the rate of change of theintegral. notice the three ideas sum, area, and rate ofchange

- Holy shit! Taylor series makes sense now! (Thanks 3b1b). Howthis works: we take a sample point then try to match the polynomialthat we're trying to get at at different orders of derivative.That's why factorial happens: when we take derivative of x^n ntimes, we should get (n! * x)
- It's just a series of shameful and sad days
- I hope I can at least salvage one hope by eliminating all ofthe others
- Taylor series: I see what you did there with x - a: you'retrying to map the graph to another coordinate system so that when x= a, t = 0. Therefore, t = x - a. Note that you must try buildingthe series FROM THE GROUND UP to be able to fully grasp why thepoint of focus must be at t = 0

- A million dollars, but... Every time you do something, you mustset the timer for it and you must complete the job working thattime. If you set it to short, you must stop the job immediately andcannot do it again for the rest of the day. If you set too long,you must keep doing it until the timer goes off

- Similarly to my previous thoughts: The function of the brain issimilar to that of a computer program. We can divide the code intomultiple functions so that each person knows one specific functionand they can communicate through a common language. You can dig asdeep as you want, depending on how many functions you're willing tofully comprehend. Comprehending a function means replicating theentire function in your brain (every variables and loops...)

- + We don't have to prove everything, coach
- + Split your project into many small pieces, NEVEROVEREXTEND
- + As I expected, understanding meansmemorizing as much as possible. Sure you can use tricksto memorize the relations between things by asking questions, butthat won't beat brute memorization.
- + Extended from the text above, I often try to not memorize byrelating knowledge from the one I have memorized to another, butthere are times when this method is so deadly: completely new andunrelated knowledge. So don't feel guilty when you skip some partsor not understand something completely: that's not your fault

- And I tried again to systematically write down mathematics-> failed miserably again because the syntax is simply toogoddamn long (If you don't want to include semantics then you'rejust fucking dead). If you want to systematically write thingsdown, you must write a really long interpreter. And theonly way that an interpreter for everything could be written downis in my own head.
- I'm really far from cracking the code of nature. Way furtherthan I thought. But let's start from something, even though wemight end up nowhere.

- Theory of cooperation:
    - A and B should cooperate if they aim at the same goal. You maysay that this can be disproved by the rival of, say Samsung andGoogle. Nope, they don't aim at the same goal, they only share acommon greed (which is money) which differs at the subject of thatgreed

- Hash tree is better than hash lists if you only want to check asmall portion of the file. Because with hash list you have to havethe entire remaining hash list in order to check one block.
- Both hash tree and hash list reduces the amount of data youneed to store for integrity check (instead of storing a copy of thedata and then check it, you only need to store the informationabout blocks of data - which is a bunch of data bundledtogether)

- You think math is conceptual? You're wrong! I'll prove how youcan do math with basically anything: now gsl code S has theseplayers: gumiho, maru, classic, stats, soo and rogue. How do youdetermine the possible matchup? Will first we define a matchup,then we realize that there can be a way to map the set of matchupsto the set of unordered pairs of players. Then from that we definethat the see of matchups has the same numbers of elements as theset of pairs. Then we go from there to apply math to theproblem.
- Note that there is no reason to "convert" the matchups to thepairs: we can totally apply math on real life subjects

- Unless the diary can update itself (Mirai Nikki). But then itwould be significant less useful, eh?
- And if there's one all-knowing being which has all theinformation about everything and how the interact with each other.Even he wouldn't know what the outcome of everything. Because everypossibility takes time to calculate. It will take him infiniteamount of time to calculate what hours best action is, and it willimpact everything else. So Mirai Fuukin, you won this time

- My DeXi theory: the definitions involve the tokens (those noisythings) and the charging rings. Every time you buy something, youget a token and the  identification of the token will berecorded in the database (including the ID number, type of food,and the order, too). Then on the cook's side, every time they pushout a dish, they will push some corresponding button and the tokenswith the type of food will ring. The order of, well... order can beorganized automatically in the system so that things will befair.

- Condition P is said to be "weaker or as weak" than condition Qiff Q -> P, and condition Q is stronger or as strong. It can beviewed as if "P <= Q", just like natural number in some sense.It's saying "Q includes P" or "Q is built by adding P and somethingelse".

- See what it's doing? It creates a smaller version of itself,just like what we do in a normal programming language (unlike thecleverer version in wiki). Then use that along with the functionmult* (which returns 1 when one of the arguments is 0). That'sit!

- Terminal emulators are programs which act like a CLI butthey're actually running on a GUI
- if a language is unrecognizable (by a Turing machine), does it meanit is empty? Yeah, if the language is unrecognizable then there isno enumerator that prints it. Which means it is empty? However,Some languages are unrecognizable. I disregarded the fact the theset of all languages are UNCOUNTABLE! There are languages that haveinfinitely many strings
- Enumerators print strings, infinitely many strings, making aninfinite language. But only one language, and there is only acountable set of enumerators
- You want to print the set of infinite binary sequences? Trythat! You can't even finish one before you do the second.

- XOR is a way to construct conditional inverter
- Troubleshooting is not about figuring what is "wrong", it'sjust like learning about a machine like any other, a faulty machineis still a machine.
- Even counter and odd counter: you make a counter whichfunctions normally, but then you add a "odd/even" bit at the end(with odd being 1 and even being 0)
- Why does that work? Because adding a zero at the end of anumber is like doubling the number, adding the 1 at the end is likedoubling the number and add 1 to it. Kind of like in decimal how weadd a 0 at the end and suddenly the number is ten fold.
- VLAN vs subnetting: the thing about switches is that one switchrepresents one network. When you connect one switch to a router,that router assigns one network address to that port

- MACA (multiple access with collision avoidance): two channelsthat wish to talk send out signals to clear noise around them
- We can easily transform any finite state machine into a seriesof D flip flop, n flip flop = 2^n states. Note that you need somecombinational logic for the output. And the tricky part is to makethe state represent the output directly
- We can show down any clock signal by half by feeding it into atoggling edge triggered flip flop
- The halting problem is recognizable but undecidable, which iswhy loops are unrecognizable
- Wait, if we don't allow Excluded Middle, doesn't that mean thehalting problem can't be proven to be impossible?
- Now I understand how decimal to binary conversion works, if youcan divide by 2 then put 0 there, if not then put 1 there
- explaining deadlock: in concurrency, we may want multiplethread to hold on to the data that it is using, and release it whenit is done with the data. If some thread finds that a piece of datais being used, it goes to sleep and comes back again. Now suppposedthe thread 1 that is locking X wants Y, and the thread 2 that islocking Y wants X. Both of them won't be able to finish their jobif they don't have the piece of data, so both of them goes tosleep, forever... One bad solution is to say... if you don't havethe data, pause your job and release the data that you're holdingon to, but that is ridiculous because... you just can't do that.The real solution is to order the data: say that X < Y. And athread holding a smaller data may only try to acquire a biggerdata. That way, only one of the thread 1 or 2 can try to access theonly thread's property
- One problem with this,... so what if a thread says: "I'm notinterested in this piece of data anymore, let's hand it to someoneelse!" Then clearly you can't release the data in the middlebecause you may need it again and... deadlock baby! One more rule:you can only release data in reverse order, that way when you needit again you are sure that you're only holding on to smallerdata
- So what is Task: it is a construct which encapsulates a certainbackground job. The caller of the bg job will never be blockedunless we explicitly says so by await(). You can also say that atask is a promise
- Async methods are non-blocking, which means that if they mustawait for some other Task, they return control to the caller
- Asynchronous programming is differenet from multithreading:those are just... different concepts. You certainly can useasynchronous with multithreading, but not necessarily so
- Discipline wakes you up in the morning; while passion keeps youup at night
- You should stop thinking of machines as Turing machine, insteadthink of them as state machines. One configuration leads toanother: Oh yes, configuration! You can always predict theconfiguration of every machine on every "input" (initialstate)
- await can be used in things that don't return task
- You don't need to block the thread every time you want to makeI/O call

Oh well, sets are just Ensembles, how dothose work? Well, first of all we have an In thing that takes an ensemble and anobject then return the ensemble applied to the object. Union andIntersection can be described as Intersection that two ensemblesand then return a function which take an object x and return an Inproperty that reflects how we want that object to be associatedwith the ensembles. WTF am I talking about? Well, just take a lookat the standard library and see for yourself.

- Consensus term: sure it's can eliminate glitches incombinational circuit, but the feedback input adds some moresalt
- Nope! Still glitches! Well actually, that "glitch" can just bea normal delay, not a frantic phase change
- Remember: F(t) <> F(t + d) does not mean that the circuithas a glitch. The glitch occurs only when F(0) <> F(t)<> F(t + d)
- Conclusion: the error I had with my DFF is the glitch whichcauses the system to go through 3 states simultaneously, THE MIDDLESTATE IS THE CULPRIT!
- Mixing colors on paint are taking average rgb value (forexample red (#FF0000) + blue(#0000FF) = magenta (#800080).Saturation is increasing rgb value (for example the previousmagenta is not as vibrant as the real magenta (#FF00FF) because...you can't produce that with rgb scheme
- There are different forms of mixing colors, as well. the thingthey call "subtractive color mixing" is actually like adding thetwo values together and not splitting it in half, this is how lightbehaves. The "substractive" has a physical meaning when yellowsubstance absorbs everything except yellow

Every pair is assigned the product of the two prime numbersof its elements. For example, given the pair 35, you can deducethat it includes the second element of the first set and the secondelement of the second set. Isn't that pretty cool? Btw, I'mout!

- These are what I came up with after eating too much and almost vomited half of what I had eaten:
    - Ensembles: look at their type (Type -> Prop). They embodies the common property of their elements. That's why when we say (In <Ensemble> <Element>), we only need to apply <Ensemble> to <Element>. Something can only be in an ensemble if and only if the property embodied in that ensemble holds for that thing
    - Machine learning: because finding out the activation property of the output layer is just like multiplying the activation matrix to the input layer's activation vector; which is exactly like applying a linear transformation to the input vector to get the output vector
    - How can one Turing machine X simulate infinitely many other Turing machines M even though its grammar is finite? First of all, M must go through some encoding to be read by x; second of all, the input of M must also go through the encoding to be read by x. If we set up some common Unicode encoding and proper delimiting we can recognize everything (note that one symbol CAN stretch out over many tape slots)
- Lesson learned: you CAN think even in severe pain

Thought 32

- There is hardly any functions which can be broken down to nonrecursive functions
- The number of functions from A to B is equal to the totalnumber pairs (A, B), why? Turned out there is no isomorphism in theway that is interesting. The number of functions from A to B isjust formed by making A choices to connect an A element to B(A*A*B) and then divide by A since we're grouping A connections toone functions (A*B). The number of pairs from A to B is calculatedby making A choices and then B choices (A*B). You could say thereis an isomorphism but it's not interesting
- Simplify logic using binary tree: you can't really do thatoptically because there are terms that can be grouped but are noton adjacent (note that it can be explained that a tree arrange isjust 1D, and a Karnaugh map is 2D)
- The predicate of the set that create Russell's paradox (x in x)cannot be created in Type theory. There is a distinction between aset (set of things) and a class (set of sets). We can never saythat a set includes itself. For example, if a set x of type (nat-> prop) includes itself; then its type will then be (nat ->prop -> prop)
- Only when trying to create the Russell paradox can IlearnÂ how people resolve it!
- Note that a set CAN contain another set, it's just that a setcan NEVER contain itself
- Unicode provide a code space which then includes code pointswith a one to one relationship to every symbols people can fuckingthink of. Those code points can then be encoded by a lower layer to1s and 0s. UTF-8 is the most popular with ASCII compatibility. Torefer to a Unicode point, say U+<hex value>. Thanks is kindalike 0b or 0x. Why am I interested in this stuff anyway?

- How to beat the "blue eyes lvl 74" in SAO Memory Degrag: sinceits movement is so hard to predict and its range is too wide, theonly way to move is to stay above or below it. Be careful not tostand too near or your escape path will be blocked. Do not everstop moving if you're near the boss, you must have enough initialacceleration to hope to escape its attack! Use sword for normalfight and switch out with Sinon when have a chance to counterattack. When to counter? When the boss suddenly jumps back and thenrun towards you, remember: Jump back AND run towards
    - For Sword user: basically stay above or below it and attack itright after its move set. Then just keep running up and down. Ifyou think you're in the Purple zone and that you're fucked, don'tpanic and block the attack, that's better than trying desperatelyto counter
    - For Sinon: stay FAR outside of its range, you are at a hugedisadvantage since you have to be vertically aligned with the bossto hit it, so hit and run won't work. You have to choose a placewhere you are super far away and shoot from there

- What is system call really: so basically for every instructionscycle we have to check for any events (interrupt). If there aresome, we run the code responsible for that event -> it'll sortthings out based on the I/O waiting list. If there is none, wecontinue normally with our fetch. Windows had its own system callAPI that apps can call and say shit like... "Hey! Tell me when thehappens" to the OS's event handler or say "I want this file, butplease don't block me while I'm waiting!"
- How does the parties of a stream cipher get the common randomstring to XOR? They use a key to generate strings and change thekey each time using COUNTING (which is why if you reset thecounting you're as good as gone). They key might be secure but themessage is not, lol
- How to name a signal that does not mean (enabled/disabled)?Just use "X/NOT(Y)": meaning "X when the signal is high" and"NOT(Y) when the signal is high (or Y when the signal is low)"
- Is there really a way to minimizing logic function with onlyminterm number

The XOR function obscures information and restore it like so(x is the message, k is the key):

- x y x XOR k x XOR k XOR k
- 0 0 0         0
- 0 1 1         0
- 1 0 1         1
- 1 1 0         1

The cooler thing is: every 2 columns could be the inputs andthe other one could be the output. every 2 columns could be theinputs and the other one could be the output. But wait! There'smore: you can invert any two columns and the result will still besame

Where as the AND and the OR function destroy the messagecompletely. And do even expose the bits when the AND is 1 and theOR is 0

- Switch terminology: Terminal ~ Throw, Armature ~ Pole (becareful, those are not the same thing). For example, a Single PoleDouble Throw has 1 Armature and 2 Terminals. Also there are twokinds of terminals: normally open (which are normally notconnected) and normally closed (which defaults to connected). Nowthe mental image should be clear. A switch which you normally thinkof is actually a single pole, and that pole is made of 1/2terminals and 1 armature). The number of Pole should be equal tothe number of Armature and the number of Terminal should be equalto the number of Throw. Note that there is nothing such as input oroutput in the context of switches, they're just here to connect thecircuit and you can use them however you want

- Devise an algorithm for sub-2n counter: take the largestdifferent bit for example: 200 (1100 1000) and 230 (1110 0110)differs at the third most significant bit. That means we need a 5bit counter to do the job. set '11' as the default first two bits.Then count the last five. This method of choosing an offset ispretty handy when you must count through large numbers but everyset of numbers have fixed small sizes (for example programcounters)

- How did Ben build the step selector for his computer: He didn'tneed a selector, he only needed a fancy display to indicate thesteps! Btw, the "selector" I was talking about is called a"decoder/demultiplexer", it's named like that because the turn 3lines into 8 lines

- Digital Logic does NOT run on voltage, it runs on current. Low,High and No-Voltage corresponds to current going Left, Right andNo-Current. And LED can tell in which direction the current isgoing
- Here is someething incredible that I did not notice until now:one day I came across a webpage that teaches me how to drag withthe touchpad: "Double tap, hold and then drag". I thought: "Wow,that is incredible, now I know a better alternative to drag usingthe pad". Surprising, only after I tried really hard to redo thesteps did I realized I had already known how to do it. Isn't itinsane how you do things without even knowing what the exact stepsare. Which brings me to the next thought: we do know that we haveto breathe, but we don't know HOW to breathe. I assume that thebrain is modular: our unconscious's behavior does not interferewith our consciousness
- the fourth dimension can still be represented using a changinggraph of 3D and time
- Oh yeah, I forgot to say that Ring counter can be used to runtext around the edge of the screen (like pacman)
- Difficult! programming is!
- Types are just Sets containing constructor expressions.
- Look at this code here:
    - Inductive prod (X Y: Type) : Type :=
    - | pair: X -> Y -> prod X Y
- What does this mean? It means that prod is a function of twotypes which returns another type (the Cartesian product of thosetypes). What is pair? It is one of the elements of the set prod,which is also a constructor of the type prod.
- A polymorphic type such as (list X) is called a dependent type.Since a type corresponds to a proposition, we can view dependenttypes as predicates (propositions with forall and exists). Thereseems to be nothing more to the word polymorphism aside its use incomputer science
- the logical connective implication (->) has twocorresponding inference rule: introduction (how to derive theconnective: if we have A then we have B, then we conclude that A-> B) and elimination (how to USE it: if we have A -> B andwe have A, we can conclude that we have B)
- Beware that there is a distinction between what we prove(proposition) and the statement that a proposition holds/does nothold (assertion/denial). In Coq, we can see that a proposition isjust a type, and a provable proposition is an object with thattype
- Do not concern yourself too much with petty terminology, it's the knowledge that matters most
- it is almost shocking to see someone posting code tutorials on Youtube with such a bad structural understanding of data. Apparently to represent a block of board game you need an array of things ("dead/alive", the rectangle with points in it, "die"(?) and neighbors). Wtf is that? How is the geometrical representation of the cell necessarily bundled with the its status? I hope I don't have to work with that guy in real life, cuz that would suck, big time
- At the end of the day, it does not matter whether you are in a situation you like to be in or not, or whether or not you are around people you want to be around, or even if you are doing the thing you like to be doing. It is about learning and getting stronger every day you live, to me that's the most important
- A proof is the evidence of a judgement ('the' or 'a'?)
- What has been done can be done again
- Observe the variable 'C' in the elimination rule of the disjunction connective and existential quantifier (Gentzen's Natural Deduction), why aren't they in the conjunction connective and universial quantifier's elimination rule? What does it mean 'to use disjunction and existential'? Observe that the use of disjunction and existential, in a sense, stems from conjunction and universial quantifier. If something is true as long as A or B is true, then it is true when A \/ is true; likewise, if C is true when A(x) is true for all x, then as long as there is an a for which A(a) is true, C is true
- Truth is, I invented the twisted ring counter myself without even realizing it (in my attempt to make an up/down Gray code counter)
- The thing about the ring counter is that it decodes itself (turning a binry code into a unary code). However, flip-flops are still a lot more expensive so...
- This is a rant about phase

0     0     0
1     0     0
1     1     0
1     1     1
0     1     1
0     0     1

- Observe that this is a Johnson sequence, each flip-flop generates a square wave that is 1/2n * 360 out of phase with the one right next to it (n being the number of flip-flops). You know why that is? All three flip-flops constitutes a 3-phase square wave, if the phase of the first one is zero degree, the phase of the second one is 1/2n * 360 degree, the phase of the second one should be 2/2n * 360 degree. According to this analogy, all three of them will make up 360 degree (fuck me I don't know what the terminology is)
- remember, inverting a counter will slow it down (speed it up?) by 180 degree
- So finalizing my thoughts on ring: ring counter can be used to build clocks, and mobius counter can be used as a 3 phase power supply (that is mechanical thing, though)
- True Dedication: it's a combination of passion and responsibility
- Trivial math: (a^n)^m = a^(n*m). That's it for the day! No regret!

- why is Heathcliff op? No he is not, I just found that it took an eternity to bring him to yellow health and then some. He has no guaranteed parriable movement pattern (except for the response to your full set combo from behind, but even then he sometimes pauses or Smite your face like an asshole). And don't get me started on the "fast thrust
" he does that you can't even see coming. Even the final skeleton scarab you fight has a parry pattern to it when it approaches you head-on

- How to calculate the bit length of a transmission link: The bit length is the amount of information present on a link when it is full. First, imagine some a Transmitter transmitting at bit rate (R bps). How much time does it take until the first bit gets to the other side? We can calculate that using (t = d/V) (d being distance and V being the propagation time). Now that the link is full and during that time Transmitter also transmitted R * t bits onto the medium, thus we know the bit length b = R *(d/V)
- Sliding-window is just normal TCP flow control, nothing special here. The main idea is that you want to cut the transmission to smaller frames, but you don't want to limit acknowledgement to just one frame at a time. You also don't want to suffocate the receiver hence you need "window". The integration of sending data and acknowledgement is called "piggybacking"
- Remember, interrupt requests can come from either software or hardware
- Socket is not a thing in mind of networking architects, it is a layer of abstraction based on UNIX's Berkeley Sockets Interface to help programmers
- Busy Beaver: S(n) is the maximum shifts of the set of all n-card stoppers. If we can compute that function, then we automatically know when a machine that is supposed to end should have ended. But since that function is larger the busy beaver function for the same n, which then out-grows every computable function, it is non-computable.
- Notice the term out-grow (notation: >-). Which means that a function will eventually be larger than another one when the paramaters are large enough
- In a graph, if there's an alternative route from one point to another, then there's a closed loop. Tree is a sub-category of graph: they have no closed loop
- In modulo 2 arithmetic there is no distinction between addition and subtraction, hence the other of numbers can only be determined by the number of bits. Also subtraction and division are commutative
- A polynomial M(x) = x^5 + x^2 + 1 can be expressed by a dummy variable x and a bit pattern M = 100101 representing the coefficients
- Linear feedback shift registers versus modulo 2 division: the shifting part is analogous to shifting along the dividend when we do divisions, when the most significant bit is 1, we flip the next read according to a pattern is analogous to saying "hey this part here we should put a "1" in the quotient, subtracting the dividend by the divisor (which is XORing like I said) but we don't do the quotient part and proceed to subtract right at the start.
- Cyclic Redundancy Check: Now let us formalize the division process (to be clear, the remainder finding process): the remainder will be eventually stored in the feedback register, which can be imagined as a "window" sliding over the dividend as we goes on with the process. The remainder has n bits. Using the "Internal input lowercase -> Internal output uppercase" notation: the content of the flip-flops are as follow: C_k = c_k-1 XOR (P_k-1 AND C_n-1) (except C_0 = input) (P is the divisor that we agreed on initially). Forgot to mention, the length of the resulting remainder does not contain the most significant bit. The question can be: For how many steps should we repeat? The answer: How the fuck should I know?
- No matter what you do, you MUST spend some time thinking at the end of the day before you go to sleep, you will destroy the next day
-   Nice Notion: How do we denote that "X is the smallest number such that f(X) = 0":
    - X = (μx) [f(x) = 0]
- Busy Beaver: If we knew how many entries there are for a category, then by scanning the number of maximum shifts it take, we can deduce the largest number of shifts it takes for machines that will halt to halt. Here is the detailed procedure
    - We have a pool of machines: M
    - We need to figure out S, the maximum number of shifts it will take for a machine that will halt to halt, usually it's impossible to calculate, but...
    - We have the number of valid entries (of machines that will halt) for some reason: N
    - Action! Initialize a list "good". For i = 0 to infinity do:
        - for k = 0 to D(M) - len(good) do:
            - if M_k halts after under or equal to i moves, add it to the "good" list
        - If the "good" list has length < N, continue with the loop. Else, return i as S
    - note that the length of "good" list can't exceed N since... it'll be paradoxical if there are machines that halt but aren't listed as valid entries
- So how does constructive mathematics help us out of this Beaver BS? Well, the objective of the problem itself is to find the largest element of a finite set, which we assume to exist. However, we do not assume so... wait a minute, there's a part 2 to this

- Muscular complementary system: do you realize that when you contract your fingers, the top part doesn't do anything while the bottom part contracts, and when you open your hands, the top part contracts and the bottom part relaxes?
- Muscles generate excessive heat, which is then propagated through your entire body by blood
- I guess Heathcliff is kind of beatable when you get Kirito to lvl 40. You need to develop a really fast understanding of the pattern of his movement and circle around him quickly when he's trying to approach you. When he approaches you and you still can't guess what he is trying to do, just block, you can't risk being smitten by his shield in the face. The reason for the circling is that you CAN dodge his shield attack from far away by getting up or down of the range. When he does the 3-hit-combo thing, block the first two, jump back and then attack him once, then blind-counter because he will thrust you when you get close to him. I guess that is the main way that you can do damage to him: Wait for him to finish his attack, go poke him once to get him to thrust you and then counter attack
- The exclusion of the Excluded Middle theorem CAN banish the existence of the paradox: "This sentence is false". Since I can say: "If this sentence is true, then it is false". But what then, we can prove falsehood, but only on the assumption that we give the paradoxical sentence a truth value, a truth value is not a necessary construct of the proposition
- Isn't that weird for propositions to be the only things that can reference themselves?
- Rule #1 to avoid paradoxes (using the Law of Excluded Middle): a property of an object cannot depend on the that same property of that object, since the dependence can be a conflicting one. For example: "This sentence is false", the truth value of the sentence is dependent on the truth value of the sentence (in fact it is the opposite). Another example: B says: "A is false", A says: "B is true". In this example the truth value of B is negatively dependent on the truth value of A, which is then positively dependent on the truth value of itself, then it is negatively dependent on the truth value of itself. So we have to eliminate self-referencing and circular-referencing. Another example of Russell's paradox: O = {x | ~ (x in x)}. This is also based on this rule because when you think about it, the predicate <P(x) = x in x> is a "guaranteed property" of every object in Frege's universe, because we have [~ (x in x) <-> x in O], x can range over O, that's why we have the paradox. The excluded middle is the root of all weird inconsistencies you can think of, and I don't like it at all!

    - C (Classical Mathematician): There is this BB problem I just can't compute

    -  I: Oh, you can't do that with any finite set
    - C: What? You surely can. The set is finite, I MUST be able to get the largest element
    - I: So tell me how you define the set
    - C: It's a set of sigma of machines that will halt for a number of cards
    - I: OK, tell me how you derive that set, note: how do you know which machine will halt?
    - C: Oh, I can't, but that set exists.
    - I: Sure it exists, but until you've defined a way to compute systematically create and iterate through that set, your function is non-computable. On my end, I don't even want to call that a function at all!

- How the light pen sensed the position of the screen the pen was pointing at: The screen does not send light signals on all spots all the time, it sends signals one by one sequentially. Now if we can sense when the pen received light combined with the CPU's knowledge, you will know where it is because time is a parameter that can literally determine coordination. There is a problem with this: the light pen won't work with dark area, where the screen literally don't light up

- The formal way to test a system (correctness and completeness): supposed we have a behavior that we believe in, called A; then we proceed and implement a new behavior that we want to test, called B. We have two concept called correctness (A implies B) and completeness (B implies A). As we can see correctness is easier to test than completeness since we can control A but we can't control B. Sometimes we want only correctness but not completeness (when we want to test out a new drug to see if it is safe on human, with A being the safety of the test subject and B being the symptoms). Sometimes we want completeness but not correctness (when?). And of course, in mathematics you need both
- My own intuitive reflection implementation

Inductive reflect (P: Prop) (b: bool) : Prop :=
  | ReflectT: (P /\ (b = true)) -> reflect P b
  | ReflectF: (~P /\ (b = false)) -> reflect P b.

Theorem reflect_iff: forall P b,

- intros. inversion H. destruct b.

  + apply ReflectF. split; auto. intro. apply H0 in H2.
  inversion H2.
Qed.

- Compared with coq's more compact style:

Inductive reflect : Prop -> bool -> Prop :=
| ReflectT : forall (P:Prop), P -> reflect P true
| ReflectF : forall (P:Prop), ~ P -> reflect P false.

- That took really long to come up with! The major insight of my rewriting is that reflect is a proposition to be asserted with a proposition and a boolean (which isn't shown directly in Coq's implementation). There are two lines that we can derive (reflect P b), the first being P does not hold and b is false, the second being P holds and b is true. If we do not have b or P beforehand, we can split b into two lines and then provide away to prove P or not P in each respective line; since reflect holds demand that P holds whenever b is true and vice versa. Either way, we only use reflect when we already have it: if we have reflect, there are only two possibilities: the first line or the second line
- This one is even simpler: it is just a plain old non-recursive property, no need for stupid jargon (there's no need to be afraid of this shit anymore)

Definition simple_reflect (P: Prop) (b: bool) : Prop :=
